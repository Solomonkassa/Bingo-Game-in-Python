# Bingo-Game-in-Python

Welcome to the Bingo-Game-in-Python repository!

This repository contains a Python implementation of the popular game Bingo. The game is built using Tkinter for the GUI and TensorFlow for the machine learning model. The game can be played by clicking on the squares on the game board, marking the numbers that are called out. The player can check if they have won the game by clicking the "Check" button.
The game also includes a machine learning model that can be used to predict the next number to be called, but keep in mind that the model is not trained, so it's not capable of making accurate predictions.
The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about building games in Python or using TensorFlow for machine learning.

To run the game, simply clone the repository and run the file. You will need to have TensorFlow and Tkinter installed in your environment.
